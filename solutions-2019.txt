All entries comprise 7 parts which are OJ-ID, author, date of submission, tags, description modeling, major steps to solve it, warnings, with a colon stands between each pair of parts. When a new line is created, a hyphen is require for its previous line at the end.
Each entry ends with a full stop and a blank line stands between any two neighbouring entries.

计算一个复杂代数式的值;-
威尔逊原理：对于素数p,有(p-1)!=-1( mod p).-
首先，将原式变形为[ (3×k+6)! % (3×k+7) + 1] / (3×k+7)，所以：-
(1)3×k+7是素数，结果为1,-
(2)3×k+7不是素数，则假设（3×k+7）=m1*m2*m3……，可知m1,m2,m3……<=3*k+6,则此时（3×k+6)! % (3×k+7) = 0,所以经过取整，式子的答案为0;.
